# Project Xmap 
## - An AI based Crowd Density Monitoring System - 

## Overview

Xmap'23 is a project that utilizes CCTV footage to estimate and visualize human crowd density in festival areas. It employs object detection techniques (YOLOv5) to identify humans in real-time, compares the crowd density across multiple locations, and provides a web interface with a customized map for visualization.

## Features

- Real-time crowd density estimation using YOLOv5.
- Support for processing multiple CCTV camera streams simultaneously.
- Visualization of crowd density on a web interface with a customized map.
- Color-coded indicators for low, medium, and high crowd density areas.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5
-
